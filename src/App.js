      <AppHeader title="HOW TO MANAGE STATES" />
      <p style={{ color: 'blue', fontSize: '20px' }}>You should never mutate the state of a component directly, but only through the update function. Another thing you need to be careful about is that the [useState] callback does not merge the state as [setState] in class components did. This means that you have to return a full object in callback even if you want to change only one of its properties.</p>
      <AppHeader title="WHY SHOULD YOU USE JSX?" />
      <p style={stylePara}>The reason for using JSX is quite obvious. It makes it very simple to build React applications. With JSX, the UI automatically stays updated with the user-count value, and you donâ€™t have to care about any markup or logic consistency. Also, it works a little faster than normal JavaScript, as it automatically performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript.</p>
